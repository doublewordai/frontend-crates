"""Every unified corpus scenario carries a taxonomy number.

`tax()` answers an unmapped scenario with `(9, <slug>)` instead of raising, so a case
added to `gen_unified_golden.py` without a `UNIFIED_TAX` entry still renders — it just
silently lands in group 9 under its raw slug rather than the group it belongs to. That
is a wrong answer delivered confidently: the page looks complete, the case is numbered,
and nothing says the number is a fallback.

It has already happened: `guided_json_escaped_string_args` and `guided_json_array_argument`
were added to the corpus and rendered as `UNIFIED.9.*` for a full render cycle before
anyone noticed they were missing from the map. These two tests make that a failure at
the point the case is added, and name the file to edit.
