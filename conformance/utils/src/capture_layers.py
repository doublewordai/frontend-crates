"""The one place that turns a capture envelope into a per-impl version tree.

Two writers need this: write_impl_layers.py (anchor + changed-only overlay, for an
impl published at two versions) and apply_capture.py (a single full tree, for an impl
published at one). They MUST store the same per-case body, so the shape lives here
once instead of being copy-pasted into both.

Per chunk the tree stores `expected` (the deltas) and, when the capture recorded
non-tool text for that chunk, `normal_text`. Dropping `normal_text` is not cosmetic:
it is the only field markers._block_tool_call_leaks reads, so a tree written without
it reports zero tool-call-markup leaks for that impl no matter what the parser
actually emitted.
