//! Design rule: **families produce data, the driver owns control flow.** A
//! family never sees the request loop, thread pool, or failure protocol — it
//! turns decoded media into named tensors and describes its prompt geometry
//! as a [`TokenLayout`], which the driver applies mechanically
//! ([`crate::token_layout::apply_layout`]).
//!
//! The carriers are `#[non_exhaustive]` so new families, modalities, and

//! plan.
